# Dynamic Budgeting App Proposal

## Overview

For our final project, we plan to build a **dynamic budgeting app** that helps users manage their money more easily. The app will let users create budgets, track spending, upload receipts, and organize expenses into categories that make sense to them. 

The main goal is to make budgeting simpler and more visual, especially for people who want to see where their money is going each month. The frontend will be built with **React**, and the backend will use **Django** to handle authentication, data storage, and receipt uploads.

## Feature List

### Must-Have Features
1. **View Monthly and Yearly Budgets**  
   Users can see their budget and actual spending for each category in a simple table format.

2. **Upload Receipts**  
   Users can upload pictures of receipts to keep a record of purchases. (Initially, this may just save the image.)

3. **Login and Authentication**  
   Each user will have their own account so they can securely access their personal budget data.

4. **Editable Budgets (Two Modes)**  
   - **Setup Mode:** Create or adjust the planned budget.  
   - **Expense Mode:** Enter actual expenses and track progress.

5. **Custom Categories**  
   Users can group expenses however they want (for example: Food, Rent, Entertainment, etc.).

### Nice-to-Have Features
1. **OCR Receipt Reading**  
   Use an OCR tool like **Tesseract** to automatically read text from uploaded receipts and fill in expense details.

2. **Automatic Expense Categorization**  
   Use simple machine learning or keyword rules to guess which category a purchase belongs to.

3. **Graphs and Visuals**  
   Show charts comparing planned vs. actual spending over time using something like **Chart.js** or **Recharts**.

## Technical Challenges

- **Sorting Expenses into Categories**  
  We'll need to design a system that lets users create their own categories but can also handle automatic sorting later.

- **OCR Integration**  
  Learning how to connect an OCR library like `pytesseract` to Django and process uploaded images will take research.

- **File Upload System**  
  We'll need to figure out how to upload and store receipt images securely using Django’s media setup.

- **Optional Machine Learning**  
  If time allows, we'll explore how to train a small model or use text-matching to sort receipts into categories automatically.

## Requirements

| Requirement | How Our Project Meets It |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Single-page app using React and Django** | The app will use React for the frontend and Django REST Framework for the backend API. |
| **Multiple pages with client-side routing** | We'll use React Router to handle routes like `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/upload`, and `/reports`. |
| **Requires authentication** | Django’s built-in authentication (included in the starter code) will protect user data. |
| **App must be useful** | This app helps users organize and visualize their budgets in one place, solving a real-world problem. |
| **Consistent, intentional design** | I’ll use a modern design library like Tailwind CSS or Material UI to keep the app clean and consistent. |
| **Meaningful backend and database use** | Django will handle all data storage, including user accounts, budgets, and receipt uploads, while also managing OCR tasks. |
